It has been playing a pivotal role in the economic development by virtue of its potential contribution to employment generation, income augmentation, addressing food and nutritional security concerns and foreign exchange earnings. World fish production has increased immensely and the capture fishery has arrived at a state of over exploitation. An alarming increase in human population is resulting in widening the supply-demand gap, with the consequences of reduced availability, rising price and search for alternative resources to meet the gap (Clark, 1990).','0','0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0','0','Other','','5',NULL,'2023-01-15 13:31:04',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=4ouXKO4AAAAJ&citation_for_view=4ouXKO4AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC',NULL,NULL,NULL,'fapi',NULL,'Book Release','','','','','','','International','',NULL),(172,156,'Edu.

Dr. Hatha congratulated the student sfor opting B.Sc. Aquaculture as their choice especially when the world&rsquo;s top priority is alleviating the poverty and ensure nutritious food. Aquaculture has gained grip on global economy not only as a bread winner but a bloomed industry bringing big quantum of foreign exchange to the nation. Blue economy has already emerged as a sector of substance for business and trade.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Hatha spoke on the powerful role of positive thinking in personality development. Need of&nbsp;&nbsp; in-depth awareness in social happenings and current affairs are necessary to emerge as full-fledged personality in the prevailing global professional scenario.</p>\n\n<p>The status and scope of fisheries and allied sectors including aquaculture, hatchery production, feed manufacture, ornamental fish industry, sea food processing etc&nbsp; were also given by the resource person. He introduced advanced aquaculture methods like RAS, aquaponics, and bio-floc, and the possibilities of exploring its utilities in career and entrepreneurial field. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our country is still lagging behind in exploitation of fisheries sector in spite of having vast coastal belts. Hence there is ample scope for starting coastal aquaculture enterprises. He said aquaculture specialists can explore such opportunities. World hunger index can be decreased to 30% by 2030 by just the boosting of blue economy, he underlined. And perhaps this is the only solution to counter the 51% growth dip in capture fisheries. Culture fisheries are expected to grow from 49% to 62% by 2030.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Hatha said, advancements in information and communication technology, modern software applications etc. are another avenue for higher studies and research in aquaculture. Advancements in open cage farming, GPS and GIS applications have contributed tremendously to fisheries and aquaculture.</p>\n\n<p>The youngsters are asked to exploit the sea of connectivity available to them today to widen their knowledge domain. As an example he cited the new trend of utilising underwater drone and sensor based monitoring of water quality and cultivated animal behaviour/health observation practiced in modern farms.</p>\n\n<p>Need of extra reading and social orientation were underpinned by Dr. Hatha to grow as a successful personality.</p>\n\n<p>As an addendum to the programme Dr. Hatha explained his experiences during his expedition to southern ocean with a marvellous slide show.</p>','5','33',NULL,NULL,'NA','NA','23','10','Orientation','Recent','14',NULL,'2023-09-24 10:46:02',4,1,0,23,10,0,0,5,0,27,'16,18,20,52','11','608,611',NULL,1,0,'NA','NA',NULL,NULL,NULL,'NA','NA',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Recent','1695552386.pdf',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0'),(1401,16,'Drug Abuse and its Ill Effects.','2022-10-28','2022-10-28','Room No. 43, III B.Sc.

The Govt. of Kerala has undertaken rigorous steps to track and solve this malicious social evil engulfing the youth today.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Objectives: &nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>To discuss the range of impacts that the drugs have on the mental and physical health of youth.</li>\n	<li>To shed light on the ways the world drug problem adversely affect various civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, in particular the needs of affected persons and those in vulnerable situations.</li>\n	<li>To deepen the understanding of the current legal and medical regulations on drugs.</li>\n	<li>To study how the children and young are affected physically and psychosocially due to the growing menace of drugs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Lecdem handled by</strong>: Dr. Kesavan K&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Student presenters</strong>: Joyce M Raphael, Alister C S and Ahamed Rashid</p>\n\n<p><strong>Documentaries shown</strong>: &ldquo;Cannabis Question&rsquo; and &lsquo;Heroin&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Outcome:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>The session was held as a lecdem and not as a mere documentary show. As an introduction to the lecdem, Dr. Kesavan K gave a briefing on how the youth of today are exploited by the drug racket and how it influences them and ill effects are spread as a &lsquo;social cancer&rsquo;.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>The documentaries were then screened in the classroom. This was followed by a student panel discussion led by the three member panel of students.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The world drug problem remains a common and shared responsibility that should be addressed in a multilateral setting through effective and increased international, national and regional cooperation. The world drug problem constitutes a challenge to safety, national security, the health and well-being of the population, socioeconomic and political stability and sustainable development, especially because of the illicit activities of criminal organizations connected to it. The global and the national responses to the world drug problem require a truly balanced approach that considers the individual and his or her well-being at the core of any action taken. In many settings in the world, the prohibitionist approach to drugs is breaching most of the human rights and fundamental freedoms set out in various international treaties.</p>\n\n<p>The programme came to a conclusion at 4 PM.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ------------</p>','1','44',NULL,NULL,'NA','NA','9','35','Seminar','Recent','6',NULL,'2023-09-24 11:04:52',1,0,0,9,35,0,0,6,1,36,NULL,'11','613',NULL,1,0,'NA','NA',NULL,NULL,'Other','NA','NA','NA','NA','NA','Recent','1695553925.pdf',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0'),(1402,16,'NPTEL –SWAYAM IGNOU FDP Professional Development Programme – PDP - on NEP 2020','2022-10-27','2022-10-27','Online: NPTEL- SWAYAM Platform',NULL,'<p>This online 10 day Faculty Development Programme was offered by IGNOU through NPTEL- SWAYAM platform.
