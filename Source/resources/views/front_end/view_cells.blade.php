                                        Even though Kerala is a 100% literate state, the growth of industrial sector has not
                                        been as per the potential of the state. The highest educated unemployment rate and
                                        migration rate show that Keralites are reluctant to invest productively and
                                        economically. The money and man power are not properly tapped. It is found out that
                                        the basic core of the problem is lack of entrepreneurial skill. Hence Department of
                                        Industries & Commerce, Government of Kerala set up Entrepreneurship Development
                                        Clubs in schools and colleges to inculcate Entrepreneurial culture amongst youth.
